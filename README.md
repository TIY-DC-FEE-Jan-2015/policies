## Policies

### Attendance

You can miss up to 4 lectures before your career support is forfeit. I don't recommend missing any, as we will be moving very fast. 

If you know you're going to miss something, reach out to myself (or Su) and we'll figure what the best way forward is.

Lecture starts promptly at 9am; we need everyone ready to go then so we can cover all of the materials. Being 15 minutes late, twice, counts as one absence.

### Assignments

More on this in the [assignments](https://github.com/TIY-DC-FEE-Jan-2015/assignments) repo.

**tl;dr:** Make your best effort on every assignment, turn it on time, and no plagiarism.

### Daily Schedule (Weeks 1-9)

*Monday-Thursday*

* Lecture from 9am to 12pm
* Lab from 1pm to 5pm
* Review Session at 2pm

*Friday*

* Standup at 9am
* Lab from 9am to 5pm
* Review Session at 2pm
* **#IRONPINTS** at 5pm

Starting on Week 10, you'll be working on your final projects and we'll have a different schedule (much more Friday-like). Still gotta be here at 9am though ;)

There's a chance we'll have guest lecturers, field trips, and other fun stuff during the class that'll alter this schedule significantly on some days. Don't set your watch by it.

### Holidays and Exceptions

I'll be out of town (or just unavailable) on the following days during the class. TBD, but we may schedule an extra lecture or two on Fridays to catch up.

**Thursday, 2/12**: We'll have a guest lecturer (or two?) from the DC Tech community. Perfect time for you guys to learn some new skills, be inspired, and ask all the "what it's like doing this for a living?" questions you're curious about. (I may be available via HipChat and Screenhero at various times during the day.)

**Friday, 2/13**: It's a Friday, so there's no lecture scheduled, but our Ruby instructor and T.A. will be available to help out with your questions on assignments.

**Monday, 2/16**: **We'll be closed for Presidents' Day.** (You'll need a break at this point -- your assignment for the day will be "go do something fun.")

**Friday, 4/10**: It's a Friday, and you'll be cranking on your final projects anyway, but just keep in mind I won't be available that day (or the Saturday after).

### Instructor Schedule

* **9am - 12pm**: Lecture
* **9am - 11am**: Office Hours (Friday Only)
* **1pm - 3pm**: Office Hours (includes Review)
* **3pm - 5pm**: Admin Time (possible Office Hours)

I schedule all of my meetings starting after 3pm. If I'm free, I'll be in the office after 3, but don't count on it. If you ask me any questions via HipChat during that time, I'll get you sorted out before I leave for the day.

There is a chance I will be available via HipChat or [Screenhero](http://screenhero.com) in the evenings or weekends. If I am and can help I will do so, but don't plan on this. Make sure to ask any questions you have before you leave for the day.
